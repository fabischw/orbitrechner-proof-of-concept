[EN] This is a private project I've started to learn coding in python, it's more a proof-of-concept than an actual project
[DE] Dieses Projekt habe ich gestartet, um Programmieren mit Python zu lernen, ein gro√üer Teil des Inhats ist daher rein experimentell.

THIS IS A PRIVATE REPOSITORY, SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SEE THIS NONETHELESS, PLEASE CONTACT ME IMMEDIATLY

This is a proof-of-concept that I've worked on for a few months, slowly expanding it as my programming knowledge increased

NOTE: this code does not work when you try to execute it since required files are missing, I've uploaded this file for documentaing purposes only
I can't release the full version with the attached data since I've used copyrighted material which I am not allowed to publish.
At this point in time I do not plan on creating an open-source version that works

All sensitive URLs/APIS as well as the original git folder have been removed as they pose a serious security thread if not removed. If you do find any sensitive data I forgot to remove, please contact me on Github. Thank you
