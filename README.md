# Orbitrechner project

#### [EN] This is a private project I've started to learn coding in python, it's more a proof-of-concept than an actual project


#### [DE] Dieses Projekt habe ich gestartet, um Programmieren mit Python zu lernen, ein gro√üer Teil des Inhats ist daher rein experimentell.


This is a proof-of-concept that I've worked on for a few months, slowly expanding it as my programming knowledge increased

NOTE: this code does not work when you try to execute it since required files are missing, I've uploaded this file for documentaing purposes only
I can't release the full version with the attached data since I've used copyrighted material which I am not allowed to publish.
At this point in time I do not plan on creating an open-source version that works

All sensitive URLs/APIS as well as the original git folder have been removed as they pose a serious security thread if not removed. If you do find any sensitive data I forgot to remove, please contact me on Github. Thank you

<summary>What this project is</summary>

### What is this project ?
- This project was my first coding project and my intro into programming.
- I kept expanding this project as my skills gradually improved and I learned about new things
- Keep in mind this file was uploaded long after I wrote this porject
- downloading and running the python file wont work since I used a ton of pictures which I can't publish on github because I never intended on publishing the project so I didn't worry about copyright, I might release a working version at some point (note the 'might' !)
- also keep in mind this project had a dropbox api to communicate and sync statistics with, auth is also handled by this api
- I removed all api keys or similar, should you find any remaining sensitive data please do not hesitate to contact me on github or discord 
- most of the code in this projec is either proof-of-concept or trying to implement newly learned concepts into the existing project
- I want to make clear that the code quality is horrible which I understand and gradually improved, if you want to see what my code quality actually looks like, take a look at my other projects
- the reason I even put this on github is because I wanted to save the project online and give people an inspiration of how they could start out
